## Work in Progress

This book is an active project, evolving in real-time. We're embracing an open development process, building it publicly using R & [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). All code, content, and revisions are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Teal-Insights/teal_insights_guide_to_wbids) for transparency and collaboration.

We've chosen this approach to engage with our readers, stakeholders, and the broader community as we develop both the book and the `{wbids}` R package. Your feedback is not just welcome â€“ it's essential to making this resource as useful as possible.

Feel free to follow our progress, suggest improvements, or even contribute directly through our GitHub repository. We're excited to build this resource with input from its future users!

## Part One: Foundations of IDS Data

The initial section of this book is dedicated to providing readers with the necessary background to become informed consumers of IDS data. It encompasses:

1.  A detailed overview of the data available within the IDS, including its scope, structure, and key variables.

2.  An exploration of the types of policy-relevant questions that can be addressed using IDS data, with illustrative examples from recent economic research and policy analysis.

3.  A thorough examination of the data creation process, from initial reporting through the Debtor Reporting System (DRS) to the final compilation and release of the IDS.

4.  A critical discussion of the strengths and limitations inherent in the IDS dataset, enabling readers to approach the data with appropriate context and caveats.

This section aims to equip readers with a nuanced understanding of the IDS, ensuring they can interpret and apply the data with confidence and accuracy.

## Part Two: Applied Analysis with the {wbids} R Package

The second section of this book focuses on practical application, introducing readers to the {wbids} R package. This tool has been developed to facilitate efficient analysis of IDS data within the R programming environment. This section covers:

1.  Detailed instructions for accessing and manipulating IDS data using the {wbids} package.

2.  Tutorials on conducting common analytical tasks and creating informative visualizations.

3.  Guidance on integrating IDS data with other relevant datasets to produce more comprehensive analyses.

This practical component is designed to cater to R users of varying experience levels, providing a pathway to enhanced analytical capabilities in working with IDS data.

## This is a product of Teal Insights, not the World Bank

This book and the accompanying `{wbids}` R package are products of Teal Insights. While they are designed to work with the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, they are independent creations and are not produced, endorsed, or officially supported by the World Bank Group. The authors have experience working with the World Bank as consultants, but this work is separate from those engagements. Users should be aware that while we strive for accuracy, the World Bank is the authoritative source for its data and any interpretations thereof.
