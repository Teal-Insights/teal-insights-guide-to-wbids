# Preface {.unnumbered}

This guide is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding and utilizing the World Bank's International Debt Statistics (IDS). It is structured to fulfill two primary objectives, each aimed at enhancing the reader's capacity to work effectively with this critical dataset.

## Part One: Foundations of IDS Data

The initial section of this book is dedicated to providing readers with the necessary background to become informed consumers of IDS data. It encompasses:

1.  A detailed overview of the data available within the IDS, including its scope, structure, and key variables.

2.  An exploration of the types of policy-relevant questions that can be addressed using IDS data, with illustrative examples from recent economic research and policy analysis.

3.  A thorough examination of the data creation process, from initial reporting through the Debtor Reporting System (DRS) to the final compilation and release of the IDS.

4.  A critical discussion of the strengths and limitations inherent in the IDS dataset, enabling readers to approach the data with appropriate context and caveats.

This section aims to equip readers with a nuanced understanding of the IDS, ensuring they can interpret and apply the data with confidence and accuracy.

## Part Two: Applied Analysis with the {wbids} R Package

The second section of this book focuses on practical application, introducing readers to the {wbids} R package. This tool has been developed to facilitate efficient analysis of IDS data within the R programming environment. This section covers:

1.  Detailed instructions for accessing and manipulating IDS data using the {wbids} package.

2.  Tutorials on conducting common analytical tasks and creating informative visualizations.

3.  Guidance on integrating IDS data with other relevant datasets to produce more comprehensive analyses.

This practical component is designed to cater to R users of varying experience levels, providing a pathway to enhanced analytical capabilities in working with IDS data.
